ðŸ’¡ Purely made for demo purposes, just for fun, but you can contribute in we make it funnier!

## Installing And Having It Running

install needed stuff, in client directory just run

``` bash
npm install
```

And then install vite to help you run the app, in case you don't have it, you can also use any http server...

```bash
npm install -g vite
```

then still in client run

```bash
vite dev
```

and finally in server directory run `npm install` and then `node index.js` to start the server, that's it.
